What this does:
This adds the ability to travel to your guildmates location or bring them to you.

Two new options on the member info.
Guild Button -> Guild Roster -> Member Info

A gump is sent to the other Guildmate allowing them to approve or deny 
the travel requests.

1. In \Scripts\Gumps\Guilds\New Guild System
	Rename or remove GuildMemberInfoGump.cs
2. Add Ashlar's GuildMate Travel folder to your custom folder.
   (or the \Scripts\Gumps\Guilds\New Guild System if you want to keep it all together)
