1/22/2007 8:06:33 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Hoolloo
1/22/2007 8:07:44 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): [
1/22/2007 8:08:19 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Heh, neat statue
1/22/2007 8:09:25 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): interesting =P
1/22/2007 8:09:36 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): some fun stuff for 2.0
1/22/2007 8:09:56 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Anyhow, come to ..hmm... one second =P
1/22/2007 8:10:49 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): This is the bow I was talking about
1/22/2007 8:12:24 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Double click the arrow in the inventory and the bow will switch to that ammunition
1/22/2007 8:12:31 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): It auto-reverts back to normal arrows, should you run out
1/22/2007 8:13:06 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): I dont have very good aim =P
1/22/2007 8:13:34 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): I made it burn now
1/22/2007 8:13:45 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): It's kinda fun to play with the types you can do
1/22/2007 8:14:46 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): cool
1/22/2007 8:14:52 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Try these ones overhere
1/22/2007 8:14:55 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): ->
1/22/2007 8:15:36 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): theres ALL kinds of things we could do with these =)
1/22/2007 8:15:41 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): yeah
1/22/2007 8:16:06 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Would something like this be too powerful?
1/22/2007 8:16:07 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): you could do ice with the new crystals
1/22/2007 8:16:32 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): I think if we keep access to them hard they wont be
1/22/2007 8:16:46 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): I dotn think the arrows should be craftable
1/22/2007 8:16:55 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): We have the option of making all bows trick bows by default, also
1/22/2007 8:17:01 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): maybe a quest reward
1/22/2007 8:17:04 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): ah =P
1/22/2007 8:17:12 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): hunting certaint hings that only come out every so often
1/22/2007 8:17:18 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): then bring something to a hunter to get arrows
1/22/2007 8:17:38 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): we can work out the details later
1/22/2007 8:17:39 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Hmmm
1/22/2007 8:17:53 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Yeah =) Just thought I'd pass it along.. I dont have too many other ideas for other arrows yet
1/22/2007 8:18:09 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): ice could have a chance to freez or paralyze
1/22/2007 8:18:37 PM: 127.0.0.1: 0x1 "Stormwolf" ('Stormwolf'): really cool though
1/22/2007 8:18:44 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Thats doable.. Pretty much anything is doable the way its coded, which is nice
1/22/2007 8:18:59 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): The main bow script is ugly, but the arrows code very easy
1/22/2007 8:19:34 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Heh, grinder wants help with something on the live server. Anywho, see ya =)
