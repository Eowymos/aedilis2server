1/22/2007 8:09:25 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): interesting =P
1/22/2007 8:09:56 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Anyhow, come to ..hmm... one second =P
1/22/2007 8:10:49 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): This is the bow I was talking about
1/22/2007 8:12:24 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Double click the arrow in the inventory and the bow will switch to that ammunition
1/22/2007 8:12:31 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): It auto-reverts back to normal arrows, should you run out
1/22/2007 8:13:06 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): I dont have very good aim =P
1/22/2007 8:13:34 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): I made it burn now
1/22/2007 8:13:45 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): It's kinda fun to play with the types you can do
1/22/2007 8:14:52 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Try these ones overhere
1/22/2007 8:14:55 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): ->
1/22/2007 8:15:36 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): theres ALL kinds of things we could do with these =)
1/22/2007 8:16:06 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Would something like this be too powerful?
1/22/2007 8:16:55 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): We have the option of making all bows trick bows by default, also
1/22/2007 8:17:04 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): ah =P
1/22/2007 8:17:39 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Hmmm
1/22/2007 8:17:53 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Yeah =) Just thought I'd pass it along.. I dont have too many other ideas for other arrows yet
1/22/2007 8:18:44 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Thats doable.. Pretty much anything is doable the way its coded, which is nice
1/22/2007 8:18:59 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): The main bow script is ugly, but the arrows code very easy
1/22/2007 8:19:34 PM: 68.60.118.181: 0x8A "Katt" ('Katt'): Heh, grinder wants help with something on the live server. Anywho, see ya =)
